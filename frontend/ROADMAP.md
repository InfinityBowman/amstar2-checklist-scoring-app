Format needs to be updated to create a review, then add checklists to that review

- pdfs can be linked to reviews
- Checklists dont need a name since reviews have that
- Polish up the checklist page
  - navbar, pdf viewer, edit the review it's part of

## Sync Plan

### Read

- Use createShape to pull from ElectricSQL when online.
- Add a layer for ElectricSQL sync that integrates with my state context and indexeddb.
- ElectricSQL should call AppState methods and those will handle updating indexeddb and
  propogating the state
- Make sure auth is fine, ElectricSQL needs to be integrated with FastAPI or Auth in some way.

### Write

- Need another indexeddb database to track changes and make POST requests when connectivity is regained
- This extra table has things removed from it on successful writes
- We need to be able to handle rejected writes.
  - If the user reconnects and is not logged the server would not allow writes
  - If there is some conflict that prevents the write such as a more recent edit timestamp in the server db
